## Project Overview

This README serves as a comprehensive guide to the project, encompassing its purpose, setup instructions, and data model intricacies.

* **Purpose:** This project attempts to reproduce challenges often faced when building a Data Warehouse. The main objetivo of this project is to showcase skills acquired during studies.
* **Technologies:**
    * Database: MySQL
    * Data Integration: Airbyte
    * Operational System: Linux (RHEL)
* **Data Sources:** For the purpose of this project, a fictitious OLTP system was simulated with an small amount of data, to provide means to implement our ETL sulution.

## Getting Started

This section meticulously outlines the steps required to set up and operate the project.

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * MySQL:
        * Ensure a running MySQL instance exists, along with a dedicated database established for the data warehouse.
        * Create a new user as shown in the file: [`sql-files/1. source/1.2 creating_user.sql`](https://github.com/xpcosmos/data-warehouse-store/blob/main/sql-files/1.%20source/1.2%20creating_user.sql)
        * Create the same structure of tables presented in the file [`sql-files/1. source/1.1 creating_tables.sql`](https://github.com/xpcosmos/data-warehouse-store/blob/main/sql-files/1.%20source/1.1%20%20creating_tables.sql)
    * Airbyte:
        * [Pending]
